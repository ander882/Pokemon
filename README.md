# tcg Pokemon

We play Pauper here in the house.  Try to keep away from a pay to win...  
ie, Daddy would loose...



Note:

As this is Pauper,

a LOT of these cards here can't be used, but it is a great look at what is done elsewhere so we can make a good pauper deck...  At least that is the goal.
