Toward a Pokemon Pauper Rat deck

Just researching decks I find on the Internet to help my daughter (and I) build a rat deck.

Each file will contain a url and the deck that I found there.  Simple

There are 2 'all-' files that contain all of the pokemon (only) and item/support cards.
Just to see in one place what people are doing...
