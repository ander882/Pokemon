Just some fight pauper research...

The all..  file names contain all of the (P)okemon 
and all of the items from all of the decks here.  
They are an easy way to see what people are using 
With their decks.

Example:  All 4 decks have 4 Lillie's Poke Dolls.  
But should YOU have them in your deck?  ???

Non Pauper decks I've found.
