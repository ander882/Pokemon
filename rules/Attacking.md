# Full details of attacking

For most attacks, the order in which you do things doesn’t really matter. However, for a complicated attack, here are the full steps:

A) Look at your Pokémon and decide which attack to use. Make sure you have the correct Energy attached.
Then, announce you are using that attack.

B) Apply any effects that might alter or cancel the attack. For example, if an attack that was used against your Pokémon
last turn says, “If the Defending Pokémon tries to attack during your opponent’s next turn, your opponent flips a coin.
If tails, that attack doesn’t happen.” (But remember—if an Active Pokémon moves to the Bench, all effects of attacks
go away. So if your Active Pokémon has changed since your opponent used the attack in this example, you don’t have
to flip a coin.)

C) If your Active Pokémon is Confused, check now to see if its attack doesn’t happen.

D) Make any choices the attack requires you to make. For example, if an attack says, “Choose 1 of your opponent’s
Benched Pokémon,” you would make that choice now.

E) Do anything the attack requires you to do to use it. For example, you must flip a coin if an attack says “Flip a coin.
If tails, this attack does nothing.”

F) Apply any effects that happen before damage, then place damage counters, and then do all other effects.

Figuring out how many damage counters to place is usually straightforward. However, if many things are changing the damage,
follow these steps in this order:

1) Start with the base damage printed to the right of the attack. If an ×, –, or + is printed next to it, the attack text will tell
you how much damage to do. If an attack tells you to put damage counters on a Pokémon, you have no more
calculations to do because damage counters aren’t affected by Weakness, Resistance, or any other effects on a Pokémon.
Just put those damage counters on the affected Pokémon!

2) Figure out damage effects on your Active Pokémon based on Trainer cards or any other relevant effects. For example,
if your Pokémon used an attack last turn that said, “During your next turn, this Pokémon’s attacks do 40 more damage
(before applying Weakness and Resistance),” then add that in. Stop if the base damage is 0 (or if the attack does not do any
damage at all). Otherwise, keep going.

3) Increase the damage by the amount next to your opponent’s Active Pokémon’s Weakness, if it has Weakness to your
Active Pokémon’s type.

4) Reduce the damage by the amount next to your opponent’s Active Pokémon’s Resistance, if it has Resistance to your
Active Pokémon’s type.

5) Figure out damage effects of Trainer or Energy cards, or other effects on your opponent’s Active Pokémon. For example,
if your opponent’s Active Pokémon has an Ability that says “This Pokémon takes 20 less damage from attacks
(after applying Weakness and Resistance).”

6) For each 10 damage of the final attack, put 1 damage counter on the affected Pokémon. If the damage is 0 or less,
don’t put on any damage counters!
