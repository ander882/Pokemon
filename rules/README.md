## Setting Up to Play
1. Shake hands with your opponent.
2. Flip a coin. The winner of the coin flip decides which player goes first.
3. Shuffle your 60-card deck and draw the top 7 cards.
4. Check to see if you have any Basic Pokémon in your hand.
5. Put one of your Basic Pokémon face down as your Active Pokémon.
6. Put up to 5 more Basic Pokémon face down on your Bench.
If you don’t have any Basic Pokémon, what do you do? First, reveal your hand to your opponent and shuffle your hand
back into your deck. Then, draw 7 more cards. If you still don’t have any Basic Pokémon, repeat.
Each time your opponent shuffles their hand back into their deck because they had no Basic Pokémon, you may draw
an extra card!
7. Put the top 6 cards of your deck off to the side face down as your Prize cards.
8. Both players flip their Active and Benched Pokémon face up and start
the game!


## How to Win the Game

You can win the game in 3 ways:
1. Take all of your Prize cards.
2. Knock Out all of your opponent’s Pokémon in play.
3. If your opponent has no cards in their deck at the beginning of their turn.
