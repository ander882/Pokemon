# Parts of a turn


1. Draw a Card
Start your turn by drawing a card. If there are no cards in your deck at the beginning of your turn and you cannot draw a card, the game is
over, and your opponent wins.

2. Do Any of These in Any Order:
   A) Put Basic Pokémon cards from your hand onto your Bench (as many as you want).  Choose a Basic Pokémon card from your hand and put it face up onto your Bench. Your Bench can hold up to 5 Pokémon.

   B) Evolve Pokémon (as many as you want).
If you have a card in your hand that says “Evolves from X,” and X is the name of a
Pokémon you had in play at the beginning of your turn, you may play that card
in your hand on top of Pokémon X. This is called “evolving” a Pokémon.
You may evolve a Basic Pokémon to a Stage 1 Pokémon or a Stage 1 Pokémon
to a Stage 2 Pokémon. When a Pokémon evolves, it keeps all attached cards
(Energy cards, Evolution cards, etc.) and any damage counters on it. Any effects
of attacks or Special Conditions affecting the Pokémon—such as Asleep,
Confused, or Poisoned—end when it evolves. A Pokémon cannot use the
attacks or Abilities of its previous Evolution unless a card says so.

   C) Attach an Energy card to one of your Pokémon (once per turn).
Take an Energy card from your hand and put it under your Active Pokémon or one of your
Benched Pokémon to indicate that this is Energy it can use. You can attach Energy just once
each turn!

   D) Play Trainer cards.
When you play any Trainer card, do what it says and obey the rule at the bottom of the
card, and then put it in the discard pile. You can play as many Item cards as you like.
Supporter cards are played like Item cards, but you can play only one Supporter card
each turn.

RULE CHANGE: Starting with the Sword & Shield Series, the player who goes first cannot
play a Supporter card on their first turn.

Stadium cards have a few special rules:
• A Stadium stays in play when you play it.
• Only one Stadium can be in play at a time—if a new one comes into play, discard the old
one and end its effects.
• You can’t play a Stadium card if a Stadium with the same name is already in play.
• You can play only one Stadium card each turn.

   E) Retreat your Active Pokémon (once per turn)
On most turns, you probably will not retreat, but if your Active Pokémon has lots of
damage counters on it, you might want to retreat it and bring out a Pokémon from your Bench
to fight instead. You may also want to do this if you have a strong Pokémon on the Bench
ready to battle!

To retreat, you must discard 1 Energy from your Active Pokémon for each listed in its
Retreat Cost. If no are listed, it retreats for free. Then, you switch that retreating Pokémon
with a Pokémon from your Bench. Keep all damage counters and all attached cards with each
Pokémon when they switch. Pokémon that are Asleep or Paralyzed cannot retreat.
When your Active Pokémon goes to your Bench (whether it retreated or got there some other
way), some things do go away—Special Conditions and any effects
from attacks.

If you retreat, you can still attack that turn with your new Active Pokémon.

   F) Use Abilities (as many as you want)
Some Pokémon have special Abilities they can use. Many of them can be used before you
attack. Each Ability is different, though, so read carefully to see how each one works.
Some work only if a condition is met, while others work all the time even without you using
them. Be sure to announce which Abilities you are using so your opponent knows what
you’re doing.

3. Attack and End Your Turn
When you are ready to attack, first make sure that you’ve done everything in step 2 that you want to do. Once you attack, your turn is over,
so you can’t go back later!
