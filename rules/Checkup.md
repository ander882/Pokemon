4. Pokémon Checkup
Pokémon Checkup is a special step that happens between turns. Before the game continues to the next player, you’ll need to take care of Special
Conditions in this order

| Poisoned | Burned | Asleep | Paralyzed |

You’ll also need to apply the effects of any Abilities or Trainer cards, or anything else that a card states must happen during Pokémon Checkup (or
between turns). You can check Special Conditions and then other effects, or you can check other effects and then Special Conditions, but you can’t
mix them up—for example, you can’t add Poison damage, then apply an Ability, then flip for Asleep, etc.

After both players have gone through these checks, any Pokémon that has no HP remaining is Knocked Out. (The player moves a new Pokémon
into the Active Spot, and the opponent takes a Prize card.) Then, start the next player’s turn!

## Special Conditions
Some attacks make the Active Pokémon Asleep, Burned, Confused, Paralyzed, or Poisoned—these are called “Special Conditions.” They can
only happen to an Active Pokémon—when a Pokémon goes to the Bench, it recovers from all Special Conditions. Pokémon also recover when
they evolve.

### Asleep
Turn the Pokémon counterclockwise to show that it is Asleep.

If a Pokémon is Asleep, it cannot attack or retreat. During Pokémon Checkup, flip a coin. If you flip heads,
the Pokémon recovers (turn the card right-side up), but if you flip tails, it stays Asleep.

### Confused
Turn a Confused Pokémon with its head pointed toward you to show that it is Confused.

If your Pokémon is Confused, you must flip a coin before attacking with it. If heads, the attack works
normally. If tails, the attack doesn’t happen, and you put 3 damage counters on your Confused Pokémon.

### Paralyzed
Turn a Paralyzed Pokémon clockwise to show that it is Paralyzed.

If a Pokémon is Paralyzed, it cannot attack or retreat. After its owner’s next turn, it recovers during
Pokémon Checkup (turn the card right-side up).

### Poisoned
When a Pokémon is Poisoned, put a Poison marker on it. During Pokémon Checkup, put a damage counter
on your Poisoned Pokémon.

A Pokémon cannot have two Poison markers; if an attack gives it another Poison marker,
the new Poisoned Condition simply replaces the old one. Make sure your Poison markers look different
from your damage counters.

### Removing Special Conditions
When a Pokémon evolves or moves to the Bench, it recovers from all Special Conditions. The only Special Conditions that prevent Pokémon from
retreating are Asleep and Paralyzed. Since Asleep, Confused, and Paralyzed all rotate the Pokémon card, whichever one happened last to the
Pokémon is the only one that is still in effect. Since Poisoned and Burned use markers, those don’t affect other Special Conditions. An unfortunate
Pokémon could be Burned, Paralyzed, and Poisoned all at the same time!

### Other Effects
If an effect of an Ability or Trainer card says it happens during Pokémon Checkup (or between turns),
apply it as part of this step.

For example, Snorlax’s Lazy Eating Ability says to heal 10 damage from it between turns.
This would occur during Pokémon Checkup.
